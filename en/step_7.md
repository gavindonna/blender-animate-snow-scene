## Fine tune the animation

It would be better if the car drove between the trees and then towards the snowman. At about 40 frames (approx. 2 seconds) into the animation, the car needs to be between the trees.

+ Click the pause button on the controls to stop the animation.

+ Move the green bar on the timeline to frame 40, or type 40 in the box at the bottom.

+ Move the car to a good position between the trees.

+ Press the key button again to create another keyframe. Now there are three yellow bars on the timeline.

+ Press the play button.

The car now drives around the trees towards the snowman. However, you may have noticed that the angle of the car (the rotation) makes the car look like it is sliding rather than driving. You can fix this by rotating the car as well at frame 40.

+ Select frame 40 on the timeline and remove the keyframe you just made by clicking the key with the line going through it.

+ Select the rotation tool

+ Rotate the car using the rotation tool so that it is pointing in the direction of the snowman.

+ Click on the key button to re-add the keyframe.

+ Press play to see what it looks like. It probably looks like the car is driving on ice. A bit funny, but good enough for now. Try to improve the animation.
