## Keyframe the first frame

The car is at its starting position in frame 1, and it should be next to the snowman at frame 90.

Let's set the first keyframe at frame 1. This is like telling the computer "At zero, remember that you are here".

+ Make sure that you are on frame 1 by looking at frame number at the bottom of the timeline.

+ Click on the keys at the bottom of the timeline and select **LocRotScale** to record the location, rotation and scale at the start frame.

The computer will work out where the car is, including its location, which way it's facing, rotation, and scale.

+ Click the small key on the right hand side of the keys to create a **keyframe**.

You can see the keyframe represented by a yellow bar on the timeline.
